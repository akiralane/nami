 * so what I'm thinking is to have a member variable 'points' which is a matrix of 3d vectors \
 * this gets initialised properly in the constructor
 * there's then a 'propagate' function which moves all the points accordingly
 * and then a getter which flattens the matrix into the triangles which opengl wants
 *
 * first things first - hardcode the points to make sure it works like you think it does
